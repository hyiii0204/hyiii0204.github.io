I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science and Technology, Shan Dong University](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm). In September 2024, I am going to study for a M.Sc. degree at [School of Computer Science, Peking University](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), without entrance examination.

My research interests include machine learning, system security and operating systems. 

You can find my CV here: [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
